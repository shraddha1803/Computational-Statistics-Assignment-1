$R^2$ is a measure of the degree of closeness between the data and the line of best fit. The ratio for the construction takes values between 0 and 1, where a lower value indicates that the model is a poor fit for the data and a higher value indicates that it is a good fit. The $R^2$ depends on the variability of the predictors. By increasing the number of predictors and thus model parameters, the residual variance always decreases, even if the added predictors are not significant. Therefore, the index is not appropriate for choosing a regression model because a model with more parameters 
always tends to be preferred over a model with fewer parameters. In this report, we will investigate this problem, find possible solutions and test on the real-world dataset.
